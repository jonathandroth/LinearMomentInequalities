%%%%% Reshape data %%%%%%%
% The following block of code reshapes the data into a "long format." That
% is, I will have one column indicating the period t, one column indicating
% hte weight class g. There will then be columns in_t and in_tminus1,
% indicating whether the truck with weight g was in in period t and whether
% it was in in period t-1


%Create two matrices, one with all the observations from period t=1 through
%T, and one with all the observations from period t=0 through t-1

%These will be reshaped into vectors in_t and in_tminus1

Jft_thisperiod = Jft( 2:(T+1), :);
Jft_lastperiod = Jft( 1:T, :);

%Create a matrix indicating the year of each observation in Jft_thisperiod
t_mat = repmat( (1:T)', 1, G); 
%Create a matrix indicating the g of each observation in Jft_thisperiod
g_mat = repmat( (1:G), T, 1);

%Reshape all of the above matrices into vectors
in_t = Jft_thisperiod(:);
in_tminus1 = Jft_lastperiod(:);

t = t_mat(:);
g = g_mat(:);
